bingelo
======

A python game for practicing converting numbers from one base to another.

Named for a tech who I trained many moons ago.

Usage
---------------------
Run the script with no args, it is menu driven.

Answers can be given with or without base indicator (0x for hex, 0b for binary), but I would recommend not using
it.

Example of usage:

I've tested a ton of problems and have had no issues. Let me know if you run into any unexpected behavior.
